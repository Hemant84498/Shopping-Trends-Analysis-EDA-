## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Shopping Trends dataset to understand customer purchasing behavior, spending patterns, and relationships between different features. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights using data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques.

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Analyze customer demographics and shopping behavior  
- Identify purchasing and spending trends  
- Detect patterns across different categories  
- Explore relationships between numerical features  
- Generate insights to support data-driven decisions
